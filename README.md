# Relational vs. Non-Relational Database #
* https://www.guru99.com/nosql-tutorial.html

* A relational database is structured, meaning the data is organized in tables. Many times, the data within these tables have relationships with one another, or dependencies. 
* SQL Databases (Relational) SQL is short for Structured Query Language, basically meaning a very firm way of sorting through data in the form of tables, columns, and rows.
* popular SQL database systems include: Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB
* NoSQL Databases (Non-Relational)In contrast to a relational database, a NoSQL database is one that is less structured/confined in format, and thus, allows for more flexibility and adaptability.
* popular NoSQL databases include: MongoDB, Google Cloud Firestore, Cassandra,Redis, Amazon DynamoDB
1. Type of NoSQL Databse
      - Document-based databases : MongoDB, Riak, 
      - Key-value stores : Redis
      - Column-oriented databases: Cassandra
      - Graph-based databases: Neo4J, FlockDB
