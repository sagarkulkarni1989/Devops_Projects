# SDLC #
Software Development Process is a long journey. Multiple components of software need to be developed simultaneously within short deadline.
* Methods of SDLC
1. Waterfall
2. Spiral
3. Agile
4. Scrum
5. Lean
# DevOps ? #
DevOps is more of a development culture that focuses on producing quality product as efficiently as possible.
Its helps automate the whole software development process and hence increase efficiency and decrease costs.
1. Improves deployment frequency 
2. Achieves faster time to market
3. Improves mean time to recovery
4. Lowers the failure rate of new releases

# Agile # 
Its a software development methodology which promotes shorter development life-cycles and where there is a feedback loop that priorities the customers fedback and changes that need to be made according to it.
1. Transparency
2. Predictable Costs and Schedule 
3. Allows for change
4. Improve Quality

* Devops and agile
1. Communication
	* Agile : Dev+ test+ BA
	* DevOps: Dev+ test+ BA + Ops
2. Automation and Quick feedback 
	* Agile : Interations, Extreme programming and CI/CD 
	* DevOps : Agile + IaaC + Observability

# Relational vs. Non-Relational Database #
* https://www.guru99.com/nosql-tutorial.html

* A relational database is structured, meaning the data is organized in tables. Many times, the data within these tables have relationships with one another, or dependencies. 
* SQL Databases (Relational) SQL is short for Structured Query Language, basically meaning a very firm way of sorting through data in the form of tables, columns, and rows.
* popular SQL database systems include: Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB
* NoSQL Databases (Non-Relational)In contrast to a relational database, a NoSQL database is one that is less structured/confined in format, and thus, allows for more flexibility and adaptability.
* popular NoSQL databases include: MongoDB, Google Cloud Firestore, Cassandra,Redis, Amazon DynamoDB
1. Type of NoSQL Databse
      - Document-based databases : MongoDB, Riak, 
      - Key-value stores : Redis
      - Column-oriented databases: Cassandra
      - Graph-based databases: Neo4J, FlockDB
